# 🧩 Task 5: Convert Core Requirements into User Stories
**Project:** Airbnb Clone Backend
**Date:** October 22, 2025
**Author:** Chijioke Chika

---

## 🎯 Objective
Transform the **core functional requirements** of the Airbnb Clone backend into **clear user stories**.
User stories help define the system from the **end user’s perspective**, ensuring each feature delivers real-world value.

---

## 📘 What Are User Stories?
A **user story** describes a feature or functionality in simple, human language — focusing on the *who*, *what*, and *why*.
Each story typically follows this format:

> **As a [type of user], I want to [perform an action] so that I can [achieve a goal].**

---

## 🧩 User Stories

### 🧍‍♂️ 1. User Registration & Authentication
> As a new user, I want to be able to register an account using my email or social login so that I can access and use the platform as a guest or host.

---

### 🏡 2. Property Listing Management
> As a host, I want to create, edit, and delete property listings so that I can offer my spaces for rent to potential guests.

---

### 🔍 3. Search & Filtering
> As a guest, I want to search for properties by location, price, amenities, and number of guests so that I can quickly find suitable accommodations.

---

### 📆 4. Booking & Availability
> As a guest, I want to book a property for specific dates and view booking status so that I can confirm my stay without double-booking issues.

---

### 💳 5. Payment & Confirmation
> As a guest, I want to make secure payments for my bookings so that I can complete my reservation and receive confirmation.

---

### ⭐ 6. Reviews & Ratings
> As a guest, I want to leave a review and rating after my stay so that I can share my experience and help others make informed decisions.

---

### 🧑‍💼 7. Admin Management
> As an admin, I want to monitor and manage users, listings, and transactions so that I can ensure the platform runs smoothly and securely.

---

## 🧠 Additional Notes
- Each story will later be broken into **technical tasks** and **API endpoints** during backend implementation.
- These stories cover **core interactions** for guests, hosts, and admins within the platform.

---

## ✅ Deliverables
- [x] 5+ well-defined user stories based on the project’s core requirements
- [x] Written in a clear, structured markdown format for documentation
- [x] Ready for issue tracking and sprint planning in GitHub Projects or Jira
